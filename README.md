Real Estate Price Prediction
This project aims to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and GridSearchCV to find the best model and its parameters for prediction.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and accuracy.
Model Selection: Use GridSearchCV to find the best model among Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressor.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Price Prediction: Predict real estate prices based on user input.
